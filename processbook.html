    <h2 class="subheading">Overview/Motivation</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">When we were thinking about what to make our project on, basketball came to mind quickly,
        because there is an immense
        amount of data to be used. However, many basketball statistical websites already exists. Mostly, these websites
        exist so a user
        can input one player or team, and get that player or team's statistics. </p>
    <p class="bodyText">When looking at some of these other websites, we noticed two common issues that we wanted to
        solve.
        The first is that the data almost always made it difficult to compare directly between two teams. Team
        statistics, which
        are arguably even more important than player statistics because they correlate more with team wins, are often
        buried 6-7 clicks
        away on basketball websites. This means to compare two teams, one would need to open two separate windows, write
        down relevant
        statistics themselves, and then compare their written notes. </p>
    <p class="bodyText">Not only is this a painful process for the user, it also leaves them with the task of deciding
        which data
        points are most important to compare. Often there are hundreds of statistical categories that are given equal
        relevance and
        space on the screen, and the user has to have the knowledge and ability to sift through all of them to pick the
        most important. </p>
    <p class="bodyText">This leads us to the other common issue we wanted to solve- there are few, if any, NBA websites
        that are
        truly beginner friendly. If someone wants to get into this wonderful sport themselves, they would be completely
        lost on finding
        even the most basic information like which teams have been best throughout history. This is because that
        information is hidden
        behind abbreviations that a beginner wouldn't understand, and is difficult to determine numerically with no
        visuals.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">So, we set out to make the most intuitive, beginnner friendly way for users to visually compare
        teams in
        key statistics over time. We chose these statistics so the beginner user doesn't have to, and we showed why
        those statistics
        are so important, as well as whether they are offensive or defensive measurements. Then, we used charts that
        would make
        for easy comparison. The line chart is great for comparison between two teams over time, and the radar is great
        for a snapshot
        of which team was better in a particular year for more granularity. </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Related Work</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">We were most inspired by BasketballReference (shown below) and ESPN's databases and approaches
        to showing NBA data to users.
        They do a great job of making data available for advanced users, and allowing people to see the numbers behind
        the sport they
        watch visually all the time. However, as mentioned before, these sites lack a strong visual component and are
        not the most
        beginner friendly, so we wanted to improve upon those aspects of their design. This led to a lot of
        simplification, because
        beginner users do not need to be overwhelmed with options, and can benefit from a more streamlined design. </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Questions</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">We wanted to answer a few basketball related questions, but also importantly wanted any of our
        users to be
        able to answer these questions as well by using our site. These questions include:
        Have there been any teams that consistently dominate in the NBA? Have there been any teams that have been
        consistently bad?
        Among rivalry teams, who generally is better now? Is it the same team that was better before?
        How good are the winningest teams in key statistical categories compared to their peers? </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Data Processing</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">First, we created a python file that fetches data from nba-api (documentation at
        https://github.com/swar/nba_api)
        and saves it into json files in the data_pre_processing folder which is not utilized post retrieval. This was
        done in the getdata.py python file. Then, since we are more familiar with csv files, we decided it to change
        each json to a csv. </p>
    <p class="bodyText">In order to convert the data structures, we created a python file called jsonToCsv.py to get an
        output more comfortable to use.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">Below are our final data files: </p>
    <p class="bullets">• <span class="bullets_bold">teams.csv</span> : has team name and the first year of season
        they played</p>
    <p class="bullets">• <span class="bullets_bold">features.csv</span> : Abbreviation, Explanation, and the last two
        columns
        are true if the
        feature is used in
        lineChart and radarChart,
        otherwise they are false.</p>
    <p class="bullets">• <span class="bullets_bold">[TeamNames].csv</span> : There are 30 files for team records where
        each file
        corresponds to
        each team.</p>

    <p class="bodyText">In order to make features on radar charts more understandable, we processed 6 data features
        (Win Percentage, Blocks, Steals, Defensive Rebounds, Offensive Rebounds, Field Goal Percentage)
        to be relative to maximum value of teams during a selected season. We directly handled the data transformation
        in javascript file(radarChart.js)
        instead of creating new data fields.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">To explore our data and answer the questions we proposed initially, as well as to inform our
        design better,
        we mostly used our own charts as we developed them. For example, when we first made our line chart, we tried to
        use that to
        see which team was better in a particular year between two set teams. This proved to be quite difficult, so we
        added a section
        with our radar chart to help us with those insights. </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Line Chart Implementation</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">The line chart is used for rating how each team's performance has changed over many
        years when looking at two teams side by side. It relates to a team's season and will show a particular statistic
        for that season like points per game or rebounds. This is used to compare the trend over the entire lifetime of
        that team against another team.</p>
    <p class="bodyText"> We added feature selector for users to choose a specific feature and compare between two teams.
        Our initial design is shown below compared to that of our current design and implementation.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText"> Later on, we added overlaying lines to show the maximum and minimum teams in each year for the
        selected statistic.
        This allows the user to frame their understanding of the data, and know how the teams stacked up against the
        best and worst.
        We also added vertical dashed lines to help the user see when data started being tracked, or when teams were
        created.
        This helps the user not be distracted by less useful data. We also added tooltips due to user feedback.

    <h2 class="subheading">Radar Chart Implementation</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">The radar chart is used for comparing 6 features (Win Percentage, Blocks, Steals, Defensive
        Rebounds, Offensive Rebounds, Field Goal Percentage) of two teams.
        The radar chart shows how each team compares to other teams in the 6 features through a 6-pointed area. This is
        a particularly useful feature to have to
        compare various items at once in a different visualization. The value shown on charts is the percentage of the
        maximum for each stat in that year.
        For example, if the point for WIN_PCT of the team 1 for 2011-2012 is on 80, it means that the actual value of
        WIN_PCT for the team 1 is 0.8 * MAX({WIN_PCT values of all teams during 2011-2012})
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText"> We added a year selector for users to choose a specific season and compare 6 features between
        two teams.
        If one of teams did not exist at a certain year, that year is not shown on the year options. Also, instead of
        aligning two radar charts side by side,
        we overlayed two radar charts on top of each other to compare them quickly.
        Our initial design is shown below compared to that of our current design and implementation and progress from
        Milestone 2.

    <p class="subheading2"> Summary
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText"> So, from our initial design that we created in the project proposal you can see many elements
        transfer to the implementation. You can see that the selector has radio buttons for chart types, and
        there is a selector where you can pick team 1 and team 2 in the design and the implementation. Furthermore, on
        the left of
        the line chart there is a feature selector where you can select any feature that you want to examine which is
        also consistent
        with the implementation. The line chart shows the performance of the two teams over the entire duration of each
        season for a particular feature.
        On the other hand, the radar chart displays the records of the two teams during a specific season.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText"> We also added a legend. Although things are not completely the same as the
        design, we adjusted based on what we saw fit for the trajectory of the entire project from our initial thought
        process. Additionally, we added hover effects with tooltips to show the statistics of each team individually for
        more interactivity. This was based on user feedback.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Evaluation</h2>
    <p class="bodyText">
        As we went along with the charts, we did notice some interesting trends
        in our data. One was that teams do not tend to dominate constantly over a long time span. The best teams in the
        NBA still have
        long winning droughts where they rebuild and retool the team, then get back on top after a few years. The top
        teams are the
        ones that can keep these droughts short and their winning stretches long, like the Boston Celtics. Most teams
        also do not stay bad
        forever. A great example is the Golden State Warriors, who were the laughingstock of the NBA for years, then
        became multi-time champions in the mid 2010s.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        As far as usability, our website does what it set out to do. In our user studies, users were able to answer
        direct questions about
        the league in general, and about specific teams. They were able to do this without direction to use specific
        features, indicating that
        it is intuitive to use the site and switch between the line chart view and the radar chart view. The best
        reassurance we got is that
        most people who interacted with the site had never really watched basketball, and by our estimation would not
        have understood a page like
        BasketballReference or ESPN. Therefore, we are proud of our work and feel like we accomplished what we set out
        to do. We could still
        improve the design by adding one or two more views without cluttering the page too much, or adding brushing on
        the line chart.
        Additionally, a companion site to compare players would be a nice logical extension of what we have done here.
